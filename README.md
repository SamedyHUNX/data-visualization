# IBM Data Visualization Course - Project Overview

## By: Vadhna Samedy Hun

📊 **Course**: IBM Data Visualization (Coursera)  
🛠 **Skills Learned**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Dash, Graph Skeletons, and more

## 📌 Project Description

This repository contains my work from the IBM Data Visualization Course on Coursera. Throughout this course, I gained hands-on experience with various data visualization tools and techniques, including:

- Matplotlib & Seaborn (static and statistical plots)
- Plotly & Dash (interactive visualizations & web apps)
- Graph Skeletons (structuring effective visualizations)
- Best Practices in data storytelling

Each lab and assignment helped me understand how to choose the right plot, customize visuals, and present data effectively.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

| Tool/Library | Purpose |
| ------------ | ------- |
| Matplotlib   | Basic plotting (line, bar, scatter, histograms) |
| Seaborn      | Statistical visualizations (heatmaps, boxplots, violin plots) |
| Plotly       | Interactive plots (3D charts, animations, hover effects) |
| Dash         | Building web-based dashboards |
| Pandas       | Data manipulation & cleaning |
| NumPy        | Numerical computations |

## 🚀 How to Run the Code

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SamedyHUNX/data-visualization
   cd data-visualization
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   pip install -r requirements.txt  # If applicable
   ```

3. **Run Jupyter notebooks**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **For Dash apps**
   ```bash
   python app.py  # If applicable
   ```
