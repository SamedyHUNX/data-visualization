IBM Data Visualization Course - Project Overview

By: Vadhna Samedy Hun
📊 Course: IBM Data Visualization (Coursera)
🛠 Skills Learned: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Dash, Graph Skeletons, and more

📌 Project Description
This repository contains my work from the IBM Data Visualization Course on Coursera. Throughout this course, I gained hands-on experience with various data visualization tools and techniques, including:

Matplotlib & Seaborn (static and statistical plots)

Plotly & Dash (interactive visualizations & web apps)

Graph Skeletons (structuring effective visualizations)

Best Practices in data storytelling

Each lab and assignment helped me understand how to choose the right plot, customize visuals, and present data effectively.

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
Tool/Library	Purpose
Matplotlib	Basic plotting (line, bar, scatter, histograms)
Seaborn	Statistical visualizations (heatmaps, boxplots, violin plots)
Plotly	Interactive plots (3D charts, animations, hover effects)
Dash	Building web-based dashboards
Pandas	Data manipulation & cleaning
NumPy	Numerical computations
